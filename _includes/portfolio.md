## Graphics & Tech Art

- **PJRP.** <small>[[Source Code]](https://github.com/pacojq/PJRP/) <i class='fab fa-github'/></small><br>
  PBR render pipeline built from scratch in C# for Unity, fully working in PC,
  Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X/S PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

{% include post-image.html src="/img/projects/pjrp/image_001_0000.png" description="Screenshot of sample scene rendered in Unity with PJRP." %}

- **Deck RX.** <small>[[Steam]](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1529180/Deck_RX_The_Deckbuilding_Racing_Game/) <i class='fab fa-steam'/></small><br>
  Developed the game as Graphics Programmer and Tech Artist. Work in this project includes:
    - Modification and extension of Unity's URP forward renderer to add deferred features,
    - Toon-like illumination and fullscreen outline effect,
    - Environment fog and lighting for every world,
    - In-game special effects and particles

- **Ignited Steel.** <small>[[Steam]](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1550740/Ignited_Steel_Mech_Tactics/) <i class='fab fa-steam'/></small><br>
  Designed and implemented a "Sprite Stack" based render pipeline, which achieves
  a pixelated 3D graphic effect using animated layers of 2D sprites.

- **Path Tracer.** <small>[[Source Code]](https://github.com/pacojq/RayTracingInOneWeekend/) <i class='fab fa-github'/></small><br>
  Simple renderer following Peter Shirley's book ["Ray Tracing in One Weekend"](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).

- **Vulkan Renderer.** <small>[[Source Code]](https://github.com/pacojq/HelloVulkan/) <i class='fab fa-github'/></small><br>
  Small project used to learn Vulkan.

- **Project Attrah.**<br>
  Procedural world generation module, relying on compute shader programs and
  multi-threaded processes. Transforming a flat world to give it a round planet look
  via vertex manipulation. Vertices displaced with a HLSL shader, running in
  real-time at 60 Hz.

## Engine Programming

- **Xaloc.** <small>[[Source Code]](https://github.com/pacojq/Xaloc) <i class='fab fa-github'/></small><br>
  A 2D game engine written in C++. It's an engine with an ECS approach, that supports
  OpenGL rendering and allows C# scripting through mono.

{% include carousel.html height="50" unit="%" duration="7" number="2" %}


## Tools Programming

- **_Glacier Engine_ Animation Toolset.**<br>
  Work on animation runtime and tooling for IO Interactive's proprietary engine,
  [Glacier](https://ioi.dk/glacier), powering games like [HITMAN](https://ioi.dk/hitman),
  [007 First Light](https://ioi.dk/007firstlightgame) and [Project Fantasy](https://ioi.dk/project-fantasy).

- **TexWriter.** <small>[[Source Code]](https://github.com/pacojq/TexWriter) <i class='fab fa-github'/></small><br>
  A shader-based image genrator, built using C++, OpenGL and ImGui.

{% include carousel.html height="50" unit="%" duration="7" number="1" %}

- **Rosetta.**<br>
  Localization tool written in C++, using XML, OpenGL and ImGui. Used for the game
  localization process in Meteorbyte Studios releases. Provides basic functionality,
  such as basic project statistics, text search and filtering, content preview with
  different fonts and character sets, and string comparison among different languages.

- **Buildbot Fork.**<br>
  Used Python and [Buildbot](https://buildbot.net/) to develop an internal Continuous
  Integration tool, which automates PC and PS4 builds.

- **_Deck RX_ Toolset.**<br>
  Tile-based level editor for in-game circuits. Programmed as a standalone C# Unity
  application and outputting level data in both JSON and binary file formats.

- **_Ignited Steel_ Toolset.**<br>
  Multiple Unity extensions and custom tools for the development of the console
  versions of the game, including: 
    - A "sprite stack" mesh generator, which allows the preview and generation of
    sliced mesh assets from a given set of sprites,
    - A Localization Scanner, with the ability of checking the whole asset database
    looking for unlocalised UI elements or miss-configured font asset references.

- **_Songs of Steel: Hispania_ Toolset.**<br>
  Designed and implemented multiple key tools in asset creation pipeline for
  _[Songs of Steel](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2603300/Songs_of_Steel_Hispania/)_,
  a narrative strategy game. Among them:
    - Node-based editor for Narrative Designers to structure both quests and
    dialogue assets in Unity,
    - In-engine hexagonal tilemap editor, allowing the modification of navmeshes,
    level terrain conditions, trigger areas and enemy spawn zones.

- **Unity extensions.**<br>
  Vast work in custom Unity tools and extensions for the Unity Editor, to deliver
  the best-fitting toolset for artists and designers' needs in each project.

## Bachelor Thesis

A Narrative Engine for video games with parallel and open storytelling.

Built as a core module in [_Project Attrah_](https://pacojq.github.io/games/attrah),
its initial design and achitecture proposal was awarded
[Most Innovative Cultural Project](https://www.culturaydeporte.gob.es/en/cultura/industriasculturales/mejores-proyectos/modernizacion-2019.html) 
of the year by the Ministry of Culture and Sports.

It has been used in the narrative strategy game
_[Songs of Steel: Hispania](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2603300/Songs_of_Steel_Hispania/)_,
as the core system to handle the story events of the campaign.

> **Abstract**
><br>
><br>
>We have developed a multi-platform Narrative Engine which can help a video
>game build a story with different levels of developer and player authorship.
>We have accomplished this by abstracting all narrative occurrences that make
>the plot advance to different kind of Events, which can be triggered after
>internal changes of the game state. In addition, our system presents other
>sort of narrative utilities, such as Characters with different sets of skills and
>attributes, and multiple approaches to the way the previous-mentioned events
>are triggered, like Affairs that bind our internal system state to the game’s
>state or Event Pools, which will trigger events over time based on arbitrarily
>set priorities. Our system is currently being used by multiple in-development
>commercial projects.
