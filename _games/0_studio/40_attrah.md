Attrah is a game about guiding a nomad tribe of prehistoric humans from the discovery of fire to the final days of 
the Stone Age.

The player controls a single character: the Pathfinder, the tribe's leader. Players must communicate with the rest
of their clan in order to guide it through its burdens and survive through the ages.

Attrah is a narrative, event-driven game which generates a different story, on a different world, every time the
player starts a new game.
