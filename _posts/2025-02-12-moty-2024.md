Coming a fashionably late ‚Äîwith roughly 12% of the year past, already‚Äî, but
happy New Year, y'all!

In my continuous (barely successful) effort of posting stuff online,
I'm coming back with a second issue of the Media Of The Year awards.

In this list I thought about naming _The Lyles Awards_, after USA athlete
Noah Lyles ‚Äîa short explanation on last year's issue‚Äî, I'm presenting a
ranking of the titles I enjoyed the most from all the entertainment content
that was released during 2024. Without further ado:

The **MOTY OF THE WORLD AWARDS 2024**.

> Some titles might be from late 2023, but don't mind me. Just go with the flow.


## üéÆ GOTY OF THE WORLD 2024

The best video games I've played in 2024.

- ü•á **[_Balatro_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/).**
This game is straight up perfection. A masterclass on minimalistic game design,
and a flawless example on how to juice every last drop of fun from a single
mechanic. Its game feel is top tier, the music is nice and catchy, sound effects
and visuals are great, and any possible kind of feedback from the game shines with
unthinkable levels of polish. I got _Balatro_ recommended by a bunch of friends
shortly after its release; I looked for some game-play video online, and it took
me just 15 (fifteen!!!) seconds of video to open up Steam and buy the game right
away. And oh boy if it was worth it.

- ü•à **[_Persona 3 Reload_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2161700/Persona_3_Reload/).**
_Persona 3_ is my favourite game of the series. By far, the most mature one;
also the darkest ‚Äîfor hell's sake, you have to commit _suicide_ to invoke your
"true nature"‚Äî. And it's with this _Reloaded_ version that guys at ATLUS bring
us a modern approach to this title, that makes the whole experience, in
my opinion, much more enjoyable. Apart from the world-class art direction and user
interface, the banger soundtrack and the charisma of the Persona series, this
game ‚Äîbeing the only AAA release I've played this year‚Äî has given me a sense of
coziness, calm and routine like no other title I've ever played.

- ü•â **[_Tiny Glade_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2198150/Tiny_Glade/).**
I mean, just find any random screenshot of this toy and tell me it's not
offensively beautiful. Even though I'm a bit biased on this one ‚ÄîI feel nothing
but complete and utter _love_ for games that are just a digital toy‚Äî, _Tiny Glade_
is one of the most impressive, astonishing, outstanding (I could go on) technical
crafts our industry has seen this year ‚Äîexcellent [rendering talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jusWW2pPnA0)
included in the package‚Äî. Go try it, thank me later. I promise you'll find nothing
other than pure, sheer joy.

- üíê **Honorable mentions:**
[Chants of Sennaar](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1931770/Chants_of_Sennaar/);
[SUMMER HOUSE](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2533960/SUMMERHOUSE/);
[Caravan Sandwitch](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1582650/Caravan_SandWitch/).

An extra-special mention needs to go to _every single_ game developed
for 2024's [Sant Jordi Jam](https://bsky.app/profile/santjordijam.bsky.social).
I'm so proud and glad the jam's organization ‚Äîincluding yours truly!‚Äî
could pull out such an enourmous effort and come up with this amazing
event, which the Spanish gamedev community has received with an
overwhelming amount of love and enthusiasm.

Huge shout out to the Sant Jordi Jam team. We'll be coming back this
year with the second edition. Love y'all.

## üíΩ AOTY OF THE WORLD 2024

The best music albums I've listened to in 2024.

- ü•á **Shinova - [_El Presente_](https://open.spotify.com/album/44OiGgZn2QmOAz926hjxCq?si=OOT2-C0hRSe4NtkxcweCnQ).**
My favourite album of the year is a perfect encapsulation of the feeling
that obsesses me the most: nostalgia. Nostalgia for a past that lies far
behind; nostalgia for a present that we better enjoy and capture as vividly
as we can; nostalgia for all the "what ifs" hiding behind doors our decisions
shut closed; and nostalgia for a future that's only gonna make us grow.
Just to put a cherry on top, not only the group is from Bizkaia ‚Äîa small
region I'm deeply attached to emotionally‚Äî; it also turns out the music
video for my favourite song of _El Presente_ starts with a plane taking off
from there and landing in my hometown, in Ibiza. Funny how life pulls these
kind of random tricks sometimes.
  - favourite song: _Berl√≠n_.

- ü•à **Gracie Abrams - [_The Secret of Us_](https://open.spotify.com/album/56bdWeO40o3WfAD2Lja4dl?si=a75i_u_OTdS0HhobnT06Ng).**
In Summer 2024, the whole world was busy going crazy about Taylor's _Eras_ Tour
‚Äîand anything Taylor-related, really‚Äî, and the best thing all that fuzz brought
me was discovering _The Secret of Us_ (getting even better with a deluxe edition
later in October). The best possible way I can describe this album is as an
explosion; caused by every crush, every heartbreak, every emotion, ever. All
cranked up to its max exponent. Even though it may seem the most intense teenager
shit one can listen to ‚Äîwhich, don't get me wrong, it is‚Äî, it's pretty neat that,
if you sit and read the lyrics, big part of the lines can translate and apply to
many other situation in life; not only edgy teenage behind-the-bleachers moments.
Also, just to close with a technical note... girl, that breath control. _Damn_.
  - favourite song: _Let It Happen_.

- ü•â **Shoda Monkas - [_LO QUE NOS QUEDA DE GUAPOS_](https://open.spotify.com/album/73YCxZFDNxY1N0Y2AwbecK?si=bxuwUAUWTeSlui1EkuvcoA).**
[Things don't always connect as soon as you press play](https://youtu.be/-8Q4i2XwGY8?t=35);
you have to step away and let them find you back when the moment is right.
While this was the case for the album I've been listening to the most this year
([_Me Muevo con Dios_](https://open.spotify.com/album/7yvmtCjHcBe9DqIVl7AwQT),
by Cruz Cafun√©), it has _not_ been the case at all for _LO QUE NOS QUEDA DE GUAPOS_,
which I've had on repeat since its release last December. Precisely because its
vibe is so similar to _MMcD_'s, just with some new extra flavour: _failure_.
Every single track on this record makes an effor to remind yout hat a failure and
an error are not the same thing; that you might act the best way you possibly can,
and still fail... and that's alright. May things go south, as long as you're giving
your best, you can keep your head high, learn from that experience; put one foot in
front of the other, and keep going.
  - favourite song: _conmigo a la 1era_.

- üíê **Honorable mentions:**
Rels B - [_new star (1 9 9 3)_](https://open.spotify.com/album/6MxVqDR6nACRxGSePfK9y4?si=CMYI2jSXTomZgfSzS70DBQ);
FLETCHER - [_In Search of the Antidote_](https://open.spotify.com/album/1ZXvAPiGoqDXWsLHd3oZ8Q?si=R0JnqPFGRr-6rXPUMjthNw);
Last Dinner Party - [_Prelude to Ecstasy_](https://open.spotify.com/album/1ycq58KRtWt3wFtbuIkvLn?si=Lz-9AWh_TPWj7w7sQWLvrQ);
Israel B, Ergo Pro & Ill Peke√±o - [_Galerias Deva_](https://open.spotify.com/album/3rmxjgroZS3EVh9IrIm7dZ?si=G5s3qoJPTkyPvF-jUBFKBw).

## üéûÔ∏è FOTY OF THE WORLD 2024

The best films and series I've watched in 2024.

- ü•á **[_Volver√©is_](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/the-other-way-around) (_The Other Way Around_)**.
This film is just _so fun_ to watch. Following a couple that just broke up
and wants to throw a party to celebrate the split, _Volver√©is_ opens with
the thought: "That's not how real life works. That's more of a movie idea".
And indeed, this film is a "making-of" _itself_. With an outstanding editing
and photography; and excellent pacing and flow; with abrupt shot changes,
"imperfections" and more paraphernalia present in the final cut, that are
used to represent the indecision and insecurities of the characters...
_Volver√©is_ is an ode to routine and repetition, that submerges into the
depths of any inter-personal relationships, and shows how love is a beast
in constant evolution, that doesn't always need to be romantic.

- ü•à **[_Perfect Days_](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/perfect-days).**
I watched this movie in a small theater in Barcelona, around January ‚Äîif
I recall‚Äî; and spent a handful of weeks processing what the hell I had seen.
It took me, in fact, almost a year to find words to explain why this film
managed to hit me so hard; and it was with the help of a scene in _Volver√©is_,
when the main characters quote S√∏ren Kierkegaard. Because, [for him](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetition_(Kierkegaard_book)),
"the Love of Repetition is in truth the only happy love", since, even though it
doesn't have the rush of discovery and adventure, "it has instead the blissful
security of the moment". _Perfect Days_ is a love ‚Äîin the purest form
possible‚Äî letter without any really intended receiver, that takes your hand and
invites you to an almost silly moment of contemplation; 'cause the only thing
you can ever be certain of, is that you have this moment. So do your best to
enjoy it.

- ü•â **[_Baby Reindeer_](https://www.justwatch.com/us/tv-show/baby-reindeer).**
This mini series is a hard watch, not gonna lie. It can get _so_ tough ‚Äîspecially
if you're familiar with a situation similar to its plot‚Äî; and the main reason
for this roughness is the overwhelming sincerity with which this (real life)
story is told. _Baby Reindeer_ presents extremely complex topics, such as dependency,
pride, obsession, selfishness, pity... in a fabulously human and respectful way.
The voice of the protagonist trying to navigate the shit-show ‚Äîthis is, 
his mind‚Äî makes it hard for you to say who's the bad guy in the story...
even forces you to question whether there's really anyone in there to blame, at
the end of the day.

- üíê **Honorable mentions:**
[Alien Romulus](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/alien-romulus);
[Arcane](https://www.justwatch.com/us/tv-show/arcane/season-2) (season 2);
[The Bear](https://www.justwatch.com/us/tv-show/the-bear/season-3) (season 3);
[Past Lives](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/past-lives).
