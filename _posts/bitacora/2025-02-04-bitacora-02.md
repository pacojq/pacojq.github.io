Thoughts about translation and reinterpretation of culture,
in whatever form, shape, color or smell, if necessary.

I don't like the concept of _gamification_ as it's been
popularized —mostly coming from people who don't have any
kind of game design related knowledge.

Almost the entire concept of "gamifying" something is
centered around the process of dividing that _something_ into
tasks, assign those tasks some arbitrary score, and give
people a fancy badge once they're successfull enough —whatever
that might mean—. Maybe with some sort of leaderboard too, so
people can get competitive with other "players".

For hell's sake, games didn't invent any of those things.

Games —specially video games- took those concepts and
structures from a much more established source. In the
attempt of making _Fun_ systemic, video games shamelessly
copied all that stuff from... (drumroll) Military services!

So... when _gamification_ tries to copy its pilars from
an interpreter, instead of the original source —which,
I bet, they're unaware about-, it's only logic that
everything gets lost in translation.
