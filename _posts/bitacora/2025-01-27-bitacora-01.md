I've just stumbled upon [Gerard Gascon's logs](https://logs.gerardgascon.com/)
blog, and I've thought it'd be a nice idea to copy that format.

A lot of times I've found myself having tiny, disconnected
thoughts that I'd like to put on paper, but they end up lost
in the void —or in my phone's notes app—, as I don't have the
time or knowledge to write a full post about them.

Having these kind of logs in here will provide shelter to all
those rogue thoughts, I hope.
