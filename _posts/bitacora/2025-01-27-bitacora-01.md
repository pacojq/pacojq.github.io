I recently read [an article](https://localghost.dev/blog/this-page-is-under-construction/)
by Sophie Koonin, talking about the importance of personal websites.

'cause personal websites are cool; from a lot of points of view. And it feels
so nice to find smart people putting into words the thoughts that vaguely wander
around your head, and make you to do stuff -may or may not those be conscious
decisions.

This article just perfectly describes the motivation I had for starting these
tiny post series; and what  giving a sort of personal space for a website that
was, until now, basically my professional portfolio.

I've just stumbled upon [Gerard Gascon's logs](https://logs.gerardgascon.com/)
blog, and I've thought it'd be a nice idea to copy that format.

A lot of times I've found myself having tiny, disconnected
thoughts that I'd like to put on paper, but they end up lost
in the void —or in my phone's notes app—, as I don't have the
time or knowledge to write a full post about them.

Having these kind of logs in here will provide shelter to all
those rogue thoughts, I hope.
