Another year has come to an end. As we all celebrate that the Earth has
spun around the Sun once more and, somehow, we're still alive, it's time
to come with our lists of favourite stuff from 2023.

And, as I personally haven't been playing tons of games lately, I've
decided to go outside my field and do some _Top-3-thingy_ of different
media I've enjoyed last year. So, with the same authority as USA
anything-winners declare themselves World Champions, it's with pride
that I present to you...

The **MOTY OF THE WORLD AWARDS 2023**.

## üéÆ GOTY OF THE WORLD 2023

The best video games I've played in 2023.

- ü•á **[_Baldur's Gate III_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/).**
Brilliant storytelling; excellent character development; constant feeling
of curiosity, well-rewarded each time; critical roll failures and successes
that seem taken out of the craziest role campaigns at your best friend's
place; emergent gameplay at the level of the greatest immersive sims of all
time. This game is a fucking _masterpiece_. Just mind, you'll probably need
something around 100 hours. Not a big deal.

- ü•à **[_Jusant_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1977170/Jusant/).**
I love simple games, as they are usually the smartest ones. In the full
meaning of the word. Clever and elegant design of one single mechanic,
and taking it to its very limits, can produce a Game of the Year contender.
_Jusant_ is one of those games. Without any words and no more than one
mechanic, it presents itself as one of the best games of 2023. The art
direction and sound are great, the pacing of the game scratches perfection,
and it gets to the deepest parts of your soul with its rare ability to let
you alone with yourself. A must-play, without any glimpse of doubt.

- ü•â **[_Need for Speed Unbound_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1846380/Need_for_Speed_Unbound/).**
I was starting to dislike the NFS games. Being _Most Wanted_ the last game
in the family I've played ‚Äîthe later ones, didn't bother trying them‚Äî, my
thought was to treasure those memories of exciting chase scenes and top-speed
urban racing, as I would never jump back into this series. But _Unbound_
proved me wrong. This entry is a sucker punch to the reset button, trying to
get back to the essentials of _Need for Speed_. The races are fun; the story
mode is well-structured ‚Äîwith a nice risk/reward mechanic, if you try to run
that extra race‚Äî; and it gives you a much different perspective on the cars
themselves, as personalization is of paramount importance. Bring your best
racing on, my pink Subaru will give you _hell_.

## üíΩ AOTY OF THE WORLD 2023

The best music albums I've listened to in 2023.

- ü•á **Lil Yatchy - [_Let's Start Here_](https://open.spotify.com/album/6Per97deaWqrJlKQNX8RGK).**
Well. Where the hell did this come from? When _Let's Start Here_ dropped,
I was bored as hell, waiting for a delayed flight at the Brussels airport.
One of my best buddies messaged me: "Lil Yatchy has released an album. And
whatever you expect, it's not". Oh boy, if that's right. Lil Yatchy has
presented something completely different from any music he's done before,
and with a more than impressive level of quality. It's an album that needs
to be listened from start to end, and has no skips at all: after you press
play on this psychedelic rock/soul mix, trust me, you will not be able to
hit the stop button.
  - favourite song: _sAy sOMETHINg_.

- ü•à **Post Malone - [_AUSTIN_](https://open.spotify.com/album/6r1lh7fHMB499vGKtIyJLy).**
_Hollywood's Bleeding_ changed the way I enjoy music, and _Twelve Carat Toothache_
profoundly disappointed me. Fortunately, Posty has jumped back to the
top-class-banger level with his latest release. The album is the one with most
variety, and has Post Malone singing _a lot_. Personal lyrics that make you
feel he's just having a chat with you: reflecting, complaining, celebrating,
or simply _talking_ about whatever happened today. Incredible work with an
indie feel coming from a gosh-darn rockstar.
  - favourite song: _Enough is Enough_.

- ü•â **Caroline Polachek - [_Desire, I Want to Turn Into You_](https://open.spotify.com/album/22PkV1Le9P3X4RY4xtmK0q).**
I discovered this album with a video of a YouTube channel I love, called
[_turning the tables_](https://www.youtube.com/@turningthetables). Right
after listening to the first song, I knew it was gonna hit hard. From head
to tails, every single title in the album has exceptional production quality.
Caroline effortlessly ‚Äîor at least that's what she makes it look like‚Äî,
brings it home in every song with his vocals, and the whole work embraces you
in an almost _tangible_ way, with its unique aesthetic and atmosphere. Easily
the album with most personality I've listened to in the whole year.
  - favourite song: _Sunset_.

- üíê **Honorable mentions:**
Cruz Cafun√© - [_Me Muevo con Dios_](https://open.spotify.com/album/7yvmtCjHcBe9DqIVl7AwQT);
Al¬∑l√®rgiques al pol¬∑len - [_Cants, crits, baralles_](https://open.spotify.com/album/3mvSeMnrhY4IOpP5aUi8G6);
Amin√© & KAYTRANDA - [_KAYTRAMIN√â_](https://open.spotify.com/album/1plAqF2W8hwAhcpBAfGNsW).


## üéûÔ∏è FOTY OF THE WORLD 2023

The best films and series I've watched in 2023.

- ü•á **[_The Bear_](https://www.justwatch.com/us/tv-show/the-bear) (season 2).**
A brilliant show written around one of my favourite topics: _pressure_.
Self-imposed; coming from the outside; shared among colleagues. Pressure is
able to take you and squeeze every last drop of the greatest creative quality
you ever imagined your body might hide. But it can also fucking destroy your
life. So watch this masterpiece and see how people use pressure to cook
omelettes and stuff.

- ü•à **[_Asteroid City_](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/asteroid-city).**
There exist few things better than Wes Anderson being _extra_ self-aware, and
_Asteroid City_ is a product of that. In this film, as always, he's counting
with an outstanding cast, who visibly enjoy playing every second of their
roles. The visual language and pace is an improvement from _The French Dispatch_.
The dialogues are great and some of the silly jokes made me laugh so hard you
could hear me from outside the cinema ‚Äîto the guy that was seating in front of
me: I'm sorry. Sort of.

- ü•â **[_The Last of Us_](https://www.justwatch.com/us/tv-show/the-last-of-us).**
I mean, what can I say? I love these characters. I love _The Last of Us_.
It's one of the main reasons why I make video games, so this show needed to
be on the list. Besides that, kudos to the whole team in this series, as
they've flawlessly adapted the game to a brand-new format. They have changed
things with great care and respect, and they deserve all the good stuff that
might come out of this tremendous job.

- üíê **Honorable mentions:**
[_The Menu_](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/the-menu-2022);
[_Invincible_](https://www.justwatch.com/us/tv-show/invincible) (season 2);
[_AIR_](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/air-2023);
[_Oppenheimer_](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/oppenheimer).
