_Songs of Steel: Hispania_ is an up-coming PC game, for which I have
contributed in a range of core and graphics programming tasks, and some
remarkable work under the role of tech artist.

### Tools Programming

Designed and implemented multiple key tools in asset creation pipeline for the game. Among them:
  - Node-based editor for Narrative Designers to structure both quests and dialogue assets in Unity,
  - In-engine hexagonal tilemap editor, allowing the modification of navmeshes, level terrain conditions, trigger areas and enemy spawn zones,
  - In-engine grass brush tool, for populating levels with procedurally-generated grass geometry.

### Graphics Programming and Tech Art

The game has a custom deferred Render Pipeline, extending the capabilities of Unity's 
default URP forward renderer, presenting a custom toon lighting model that tries
to match a comic style similar to the one found in Mike Mignola's works.

Also, technical art work is present in a variety of forms, as:
  - Tree foliage shader,
  - Volumetric snow effect for cold environments,
  - Colored mask for occluded characters,
  - Level decal system,
  - and others.

### Other Responsibilities

Other notable work in this project can list as:
 
 - Design and implementation of a level and asset loading pipeline.
 - UI programming and effects.
 - Game settings and save system.
 - Navigation AI and path-finding for units and individual models.
