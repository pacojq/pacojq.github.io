My work on this project has come in the late stages of development, with bug-fixing and platform support.

### Work & Responsibilities

Assisted the development team from the publisher side, preparing the game for PC release on Steam and future console versions. Work includes:
 
 - Refactored the platform compatibility layer to add support for console versions.
 - Worked on fullscreen graphic effects, including outline highlight for player units and enemies.
 - Multiple Unity extensions and custom tools for the development of the console versions of the game, which include: a "sprite stack" mesh generator, which allows the preview and generation of sliced mesh assets from a given set of sprites; and a Localization Scanner, with the ability of checking the whole asset database looking for unlocalised UI elements or miss-configured font asset references.
