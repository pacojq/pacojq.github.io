_Deck RX_ is an in-development game, with a demo version available on Steam, that 
got successfully funded in a Kickstarter campaign in December 2021.

I have contributed to this project in a wide range of core-programming tasks, but
the most remarkable work comes in the graphics programming side.

### Graphics Programming
The game has a custom deferred Render Pipeline, extending the capabilities of Unity's 
default URP forward renderer. This way, we can deliver the visual effects needed to match
the art direction of the project, with toon-like illumination and outlines, environment
fog and lighting, and other volumetric effects and particles.

### Other Responsibilities
Other notable work in this project can list as:
 
 - Design and implementation of an asset loading pipeline.
 - UI programming and effects.
 - Game settings and save system.
 - Console programming, with Nintendo Switch, Xbox One & Series X/S and PlayStation 4 & 5 support.
